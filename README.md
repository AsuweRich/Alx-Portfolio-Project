# Portfolio Project

## Team Project did in Alx by Asuwe Richard Wuese

The web stack portfolio project involves the development of an application that allows employees to input their personal data, such as names, phone numbers, and email addresses, and store it in a database. The project also includes the ability for employees to edit or delete their data and view information from the database.

Overall, the project appears to be focused on creating a user-friendly interface for managing personal information in a database. The ability to edit and delete data provides flexibility for employees who may need to update their information, while the option to view information from the database allows for quick and easy access to stored data.

In conclusion, the web stack portfolio project aims to streamline the management of personal information by providing an intuitive user interface and database functionality. It has the potential to improve efficiency and accuracy in tracking employee information, ultimately benefiting the organization as a whole
